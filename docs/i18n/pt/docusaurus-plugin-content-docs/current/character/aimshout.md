title: Aimshout

Aimshout is a feature that enables limited communication with other players
without needing to lower your guard by typing.

Imagine this scenario:

You find a player, fixing their vehicle around a corner from you, they have a
shotgun on their back, you have two options:

1. Shoot them unprovoked like bandit scum
2. Take your hand away from the fire button in order to open the chat box and
   attempt to communicate.

Option 2 would be the preferable obviously, but this comes with a huge risk!
What if the other player were to open fire WHILE you had the chat box open?

Aimshout is designed to fix that!

With Aimshout, you can write a short preset message that will be sent when you
press the following key combo:

- Aim (Default: Right Mouse Button)
- Look Behind (Default: Middle Mouse Button)

To customise your message, type "/aimshout " into the chatbox followed by a
space and then your message.

A good example of an Aimshout message would be:

> "'I mean no harm. Drop your weapon & tell me your name. Don't act hostile as I
> have a loaded gun aimed at you!"'

Who knows, you might make a friend who can help you later on, instead of making
an enemy who will kill you later on.

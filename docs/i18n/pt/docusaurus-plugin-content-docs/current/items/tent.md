Tents are small green prism shaped and collisionless. Tents will save over
restarts, but their most notable feature is the ability to save any item within
a 2m radius around it.

The tent will save 8 items within a 2m radius from the centre, which is mostly
inside the tent. This is very useful if you have a Campfire or BBQ at your camp.

The tent also offers camouflage for hidden items or boxes, hiding it inside
bushy or overgrown areas is a good tactic.

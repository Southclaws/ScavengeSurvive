title: Campfire

Nothing like a relaxing camping trip during the apocalypse! Campfires, much like
BBQ, are used for cooking food. They are a much safer option as when the fire is
burnt out, no trace is left behind of your presence.

To light a campfire, first you must pour 1 litre of petrol from a Petrol Can,
then use a Lighter to ignite it.

You can attempt to ignite a campfire with no petrol, but there is only a 0.5%
chance it will light.

A campfire will burn for 10 minutes in total; however, during rain weather, your
fire will have a 40% chance of lighting and if lit, will only burn for 1 minute.

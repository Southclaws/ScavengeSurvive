title: Molotov
---

You can combine an empty Bottle with Bandages to get an empty molotov! While the
empty molotov item is on the floor, press Interact Key (Default F/Enter) while
standing above it and holding a Petrol Can to fill it with some fuel. This turns
it into a throwable Molotov weapon.

Enjoy frying your enemies!

title: Vehicles

Vehicles can be found all over the map, sometimes in the strangest of locations.
Each restart, around 100 vehicles are randomly spawned at one of ~2000 points in
the map. This includes cars, bikes, boats, planes and helicopters. Some vehicles
are more rare than others, for instance the BF Injection has a 100% chance to
spawn whereas the Hunter attack helicopter has a 1% chance to spawn.

Some vehicles only spawn at certain points, for instance helipads only spawn
helicopters and military vehicles are only found in military areas such as Area
69 and the Easter Basin Naval Dock.

## Trunk

Most vehicles have a trunk that can store items in it. There is no item size
limit for vehicle trunks, and the amount of item slots varies by vehicle. For
instance a small car will have a trunk size of 12 slots, whereas a large truck
would have a trunk size of 16 or more, the largest trunk size is 24 (which may
be upgraded to 64 for very large vehicles).

## Repairing

To repair a vehicle, you must use 3 tools in a specific sequence, the sequence
is:

> Wrench > Screwdriver > Hammer > Wrench (again)

Each tool works on a specific health chunk, the table below shows you when to
use which tool:

|                   | Wrench  | Screwdriver | Hammer  | Wrench  |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| Damage range:     | 250-450 | 450-650     | 650-800 | 800-Max |
| Indicator colour: | Red     | Orange      | Yellow  | Green   |

While a vehicle's health is below 450 (Wrench range or Red) the engine will cut
out and turn on randomly, ultimately slowing down the vehicle.

If a vehicle's health drops below 300, the engine will cut out completely and
never come back on until the vehicle is repaired.

### Repairing Tyres

This item can be used with a vehicle in order to repair a broken wheel / popped
tire. To do this, simply hold the item and stand at the front of a wheeled
vehicle with 1 or more missing wheels and press Interact Key (Default F/Enter),
you will then see a list of wheels to fix where broken ones are displayed in
red.

Wheels are most common in industrial areas but can also be found inside most
vehicle trunks too.

## Locksmithing

Vehicle Locksmithing requires a Locksmith Kit and is performed by standing on
the left (driver) side of a vehicle and holding the Interact Key (Default
F/Enter); a grey progress bar will appear on screen and fill up.

Once the locksmithing is complete, the locksmith kit in your hands will be
replaced by a key. This key is bound to the vehicle forever and can be used to
lock/unlock the vehicle from outside.

A locked vehicle will remain locked over server restarts and there is currently
no other way to access a locked vehicle. This will likely change in the future.

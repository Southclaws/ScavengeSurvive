title: Save Blocking
---

There are several areas around the map that are "save blocked", this means you
can't leave your character in there when you quit or the server restarts.

If a character is saved in a save block area, it will be moved to a reset
location usually not far from the save block area. For example, the spawn room
is save blocked, if a character is saved inside there it will be moved to the
front door of the spawn room (where access to the spawn room is disabled)

These areas are generally in locked locations with high value loot such as
puzzle reward rooms.

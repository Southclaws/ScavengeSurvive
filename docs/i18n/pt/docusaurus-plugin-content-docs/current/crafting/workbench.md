title: Workbench Crafting
---

A workbench can be used to craft various items which are too complex to craft
on-the-go in your inventory. Simply place the ingredient items inside the
workbench then use the required item tool on the workbench by holding the
Interact Key (Default F/Enter).

Crafting recipes can be found by typing `/recipes`.
